  Since Web Player is no longer supported by latest major browsers, I use WebGL instead.    
  *Prerequisites: Unity version 5.6 or later and installed the 64bit version.*

  To set up WebGL as your build target (for Windows):
  1. Go to File -> Build Settings
  2. Selected WebGL
  3. Click "Open Downloads Page". This will start a download of a '.exe' with the install.
  4. Before starting the .exe, first close Unity as it will block the install.
  5. Complete the installation .exe installing to your Unity folder (example: C:\Program Files\Unity)
  6. Reopen unity and your project (in this case the Space Shooter tutorial project)
  7. Go to File -> Build Settings
  8. Select WebGL
  9. Click "Switch platform"

  continue with the rest of the tutorial for setting up build settings.
